# Z-GENIE (Z-DNA GENomic Information Extractor)

Z-GENIE is a Shiny application designed for interactive bioinformatics analysis, including sequence alignment and visualization.

## Installation Instructions

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agarzare/Z-GENIE.git

# Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Install BiocManager and required dependencies
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

# Install Biostrings and msa (binary type)
BiocManager::install("Biostrings")
BiocManager::install("msa", type = "binary")

# Install the ZGENIE package from the cloned repository
devtools::install("/path/to/cloned/ZGENIE")

# Load the ZGENIE library
library(ZGENIE)

# Load the Shiny package
library(shiny)

# Run the Shiny app
runApp(system.file("shinyapp", package = "ZGENIE"))


### Key Features:
- **Headers**: Clear sections such as "Installation Instructions," "Clone the Repository," "Install the Package Locally," and "Run Z-GENIE."
- **Code Blocks**: Used triple backticks to format shell commands (`bash`) and R code (`r`).
- **Instruction Flow**: Organized the steps for cloning, installing dependencies, and running the app.

This layout will make the README easier to follow and look professional on GitHub. Let me know if you need more customization!
